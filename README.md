# ng-mobile

This project should be a starting point for my mobile websites or mobile applications (e.g. with phonegap).

It is based on

  * [Angular.js](http://www.angularjs.org)
  * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
  * [jScrollPane](http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com)
  * [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
  * [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
  * [html5boilerplate (mobile)](http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile)

All honor and thanks goes to the skilled people working on that great mentioned open source projects.

## TODO

  * SASS/CSS base-theme
    * contributing themes should be as easy as possible
  * modularize existing JavaScript code
  * test in more mobile browsers
  * filters and directives for mobile purposes
  * automated tests
  * many other things...
